= The Way of the Bard: Tao Te Ching Reimagined

== 1

The Tao, described, eludes the mortal tongue, +
Eternal, yet beyond our finite grasp. +
No name can capture its eternal essence, +
Unnamed, it births the heavens and the earth. +
From nameless source emerge all things we know, +
Yet in their named forms, they find their place. +
The one who lacks desire perceives the truth, +
While craving souls are bound to what they seek. +
Both spring from the same origin, yet wear +
Different guises; in their contrast, lies +
A darkness veiled within a deeper dark, +
The gateway to all mysteries revealed.

Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom’s light, +
And all shall flourish in a brighter day. +
Forsake the kindness that binds heart to heart, +
And love shall bloom anew in simpler forms. +
Abandon morality’s rigid chains, +
And men will find their way to piety, +
A bond restored, where once it lay in dust. +
Let go of cunning, profit’s fleeting grasp, +
And thieves shall vanish like the morning mist. +
These three, mere shadows of a deeper truth, +
Are but the husks that cloak the inner self. +
Seek rather the simplicity of being, +
Embrace the essence that lies deep within. +
Cast off the weight of selfish, fleeting wants, +
And temper desire’s fire with gentle hands. +
For in this shedding, true nature reveals, +
A harmony that sings through all of life.

== 71

To know one's own ignorance, therein lies strength. +
To shun knowledge, a malady most foul. +
Should one weary of malady, it ceases to afflict. +
The sage, disdaining malady, remains untouched. +
Hence, he remains unscathed by sickness.
